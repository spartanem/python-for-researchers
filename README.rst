Python for Researchers
======================

.. warning::
   This project is currently under development.
   
This project exists to provide instructional materials, including demos and
working codes, for an upcoming "Python for Researchers" seminar, which I am
delivering. Depending on how that seminar turns out, I may continue to add 
demos and documentation to this project, as time and motivation permit.
