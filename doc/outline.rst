Python I: Intro
---------------


Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Previous programming experience recommended. Focus is on using Python as a
  tool, not on teaching programming.

* Will learn language while learning [hopefully] useful tools.

* Python is not the solution to all your problems. (I.e., this seminar is
  informational rather than evangelical in nature. Draw your own conclusions.)

* Python is not a magical gift box; it is a programming language. At least
  some work will be required to reach your goals.


Why Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Popularity. You will likely encounter it.

* Compared to many other scripting languages, it has a fairly simple syntax
  which encourages the writing of readable code and may be easier to learn.

* Compared to other scripting languages, it has one of the most
  full-featured sets of tools for scientific computing: NumPy, SciPy,
  pandas, and matplotlib.

* Comparisons and Contrasts

   * Matlab/Octave
      
      * vs NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, and scikits

   * R
      
      * Can embed in IPython

      * vs pandas, StatsModels, and matplotlib

   * Julia
      
      * Can embed in IPython

   * Perl, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, OCaml, etc...

   * Javascript
      
* Consistency

Interactive Interpreters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Interactive Interpreter versus Scripts
   
   * Python Interpreter
   
   * IPython Interpreter

* Python Distributions

   * PythonAnywhere

   * repl.it

* Everything is an object. Don't worry too much about what an object is.
  Consider it to be a some kind of value which has some associated attributes.
   
   * Attributes, themselves, are generally objects.

   * Objects are created from types. Types are also objects.
