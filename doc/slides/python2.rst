Python II: Data Analysis and Visualization
==========================================


Expectations
------------

* Previous Python experience *required*. Focus is on using Python as a tool,
  not on learning the language.

* Python is not the solution to all your problems. (I.e., this seminar is
  informational rather than evangelical in nature. Draw your own conclusions.)

* Python is not a magical gift box; it is a programming language. At least
  some work will be required to reach your goals.

* Consider me to be a tour guide rather than an expert.

   * Will highlight capabilities of various packages, but have very little
     experience with most of them.


Useful Resources
----------------

* Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com  (Someone has probably already asked
  your question and received an answer or a dozen answers. If not, you can ask
  questions here too.)

* Python 2 Reference: http://docs.python.org/2

* Python 3 Reference: http://docs.python.org/3

* IPython Notebook Gallery: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/

* IPython Reference: `a collection of IPython tutorials
