Python II: Data Analysis and Visualization
==========================================

Expectations
------------

* Previous Python experience *required*. Focus is on using Python as a tool,
  not on learning the language.

* Python is not the solution to all your problems. (I.e., this seminar is
  informational rather than evangelical in nature. Draw your own conclusions.)

* Python is not a magical gift box; it is a programming language. At least
  some work will be required to reach your goals.

* Consider me to be a tour guide rather than an expert.

   * Will highlight capabilities of various packages, but have very little
     experience with most of them.

IPython
-------

* Copy and paste of example output.

* Pop-up help.

* Tab completions.

* Automatic pretty-printing.

* Persistent history.

* Logging sessions.

* Demo mode.

* Loading Python files.
